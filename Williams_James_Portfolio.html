<p> <strong> About Me: <br><br> </strong> Hello, my name is James Williams. I am a student....well, a ninja...at the Coding Dojo studying computer programming. I have
been interested in the coding aspect of computer engineering for most of my life, first getting involved with coding during high school with Java. Since then, I have 
studied various computer languages including Matlab, C/ C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to graduate from the Coding Dojo with a certificate of completiion and 
start a career in computer engineering as a developer or web designer. I also plan on getting my Bachelor's Degree in computer engineering as well within the next few years. It
will be a difficult journey, albeit a rewarding one. <br><br> Outside of the world of coding, some of my hobbies include playing video games on my Playstation or PC, outdoor activities
such as hiking, fishing, camping, exploration, and adventure, photography, traveling, and watching documentaries and/or travel videos. Traveling has been a passion of mine ever since I 
was a young boy watching the Travel Channel at my grandparents' house. My mom says I would tell people that I want to be a tourist when I grow up. Funny, yet true. It took me late into my 20s
to finally experience solo travel for the first time when I flew to the Philippines in December 2018 and again in May 2019 spending nearly 2 months there combined! It was an experience of a 
lifetime and I cannot wait to go back! Traveling the world sounds impossible but I have made it a lifetime goal of mine to visit every continent...even Antarctica! There's nothing I have 
experienced that comes remotely close to the thrill of living in a foreign country and experiencing different cultures and a different way of life! I would love to be able to make a career
out of coding and travelling the world with a backpack and a laptop. That's the dream!<br></p>
